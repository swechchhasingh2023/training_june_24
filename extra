Profile site
design for second project (frontend homepage)

html > Structure
css > look and feel
bootstrap > responsive (website work perfectly on every screen design)
javascript > Events & Logics

nodejs + express javascript
Mongodb
react
python

/* javascript > Events & Logics
1- clicking on any button something should happen
2- if we are writing wrong email id that give wrong email id
suppose we are writing 11 digits mobile no it say maximum digits allowed 10 digits - call validations
3- if you are clicking on the buttons pop up will appear.- Logics
4- where ever user interaction will happen or any logic will come in the picture basically we require js.
js is basic for the next sub */

html 
>wrapper
head
> all the linking like css or javascript 
& title
body
> all content that is visible to us

HTML
// there are two types of tag
inline
>start in same line
> only take width required as per the content
>span, a, img

block
> start form the new line
> always take the width of screen
> p, div, h1

self closing tag
>hr - horizontal row
>br - we can use this tag for break the line but it is not recommended bcz when we will go for responsiveness br tag is not a good option

img (attribute and property)
> attribute or property of the tag - src
> always keep the image in the single folder images and files

Recommended don't use direct url image from google save image after that use. might that url get in the future

jpeg, png, gif use this || bcz this formats supported by all the browsers.
even incase of broken or incorrect image alt will display
title is tooltip when you hover on the image

semantic tag

codes run on the browsers and it has been modern it will work without html and head tags

Semantic tags:- the tag which give structure like not all but header and footer tag come under semantic tag

Html 5- introduce new tags

ifelse
function
dom
calc
darklight mode
coupon
string operation
array
math operation
loop
map filter
rest spread
object
geo location + api
clouser
hoisting
